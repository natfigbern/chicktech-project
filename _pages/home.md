# About -

Hello! my name is Natalia and this is the first website I've ever made. Why create a website Natalia? Well, when its time to go to college 
I want to study more about developing apps and websites from scratch. I have little information on those subjects and need to be exposed to more. So in order to prepare for that I will be teaching myself more coding and how to add more things to my website. On this website I will add my accomplishements/information such as my stats, updates in life, and new things I've created. Enjoy!
