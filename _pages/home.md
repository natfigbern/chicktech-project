# About - 


Hello! my name is Natalia and this is the first website I've ever made. Why create a website Natalia? Well, when it's time to go to college. I want to study more about developing apps and websites from scratch. I have little information on those subjects and need to be exposed to more. So in order to prepare for that I will be teaching myself more coding and how to add more things to my website. On this website I will add my accomplishments/information such as my stats, updates in life, and new things I've created. Enjoy! 

Grade: Last semester of Sophomore year.
Future plans: To study more about creating websites.
Go to college next year to get an associates in nursing and a ceriticate in Office Administration. Graduate high school and community college than apply to school for nursing and web developer. I'm really excited for what God has in store for me and everyone else!
